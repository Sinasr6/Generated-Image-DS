# Generated-Image-DS
The dataset presented here is a collection, consisting of sillouettes belonging to multiple animals generated entirely using Artificial Intelligence.<br>
The Images generated are 300*300 pixels of which 256 is an actual object displaying an animal.<br>
This dataset is designed to mirror the format of other famous datasets such as MNIST, and can be utilised as an extention of exicsting datasets, or Simply by itself.<br>
The generated silouhettes are one of the following, as YOLO model (used for item detection in process) is already trained on them:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Bird</li>
  <li>Cat</li>
  <li>Dog</li>
  <li>Horse</li>
  <li>Sheep</li>
  <li>Cow</li>
  <li>Elephant</li>
