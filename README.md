#The dataset presented here is a collection, consisting of sillouettes belonging to multiple animals generated entirely using Artificial Intelligence.
#The Images generated are 300*300 pixels of which 256 is an actual object displaying an animal.
#This dataset is designed to mirror the format of other famous datasets such as MNIST, and can be utilised as an extention of exicsting datasets, or Simply by itself.
